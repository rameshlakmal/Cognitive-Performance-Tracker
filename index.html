          <h2>Literature Survey</h2>
          <p>Over the past few years, significant advancements have been made in the development 
            of systems for tracking dementia, allowing for more accurate diagnosis and treatment 
            of this debilitating disease. However, advances in technology have made it possible to 
            develop a system for detection and track treatment processes for vascular dementia. 
            Those systems use combination of imaging techniques, such as MRI and CT scans, to 
            detect changes in the brain that are characteristic of the disease. It also employs 
            cognitive tests to assess the patient's cognitive function and track any changes over 
            time. Additionally, the system includes a treatment plan that may include medications, 
            lifestyle changes, and other interventions to slow the progression of the disease. With 
            13
            this system, healthcare providers can accurately diagnose vascular dementia and 
            monitor the patient's progress to ensure they receive the most effective treatment 
            possible. </p>

          <h2>Research Gap</h2>
          <p>According to the surveys that have been done before, the first is to give the relevant 
            patient or identified person or group the chance to write a sentence or a few sentences 
            that have been identified in some ways. What it hopes to do is to test their writing 
            skills. And marks are given according to certain criteria. According to a survey 
            conducted in this regard, writing ability has been tested. Their Results showed that 
            written discourse measures predicted progression to dementia and were associated 
            with executive function.
            But here it is suggested to use the relevant data according to the two medically 
            approved assessment tools like NUCOG (Neuropsychiatry Unit Cognitive 
            17
            Assessment) and MMSE (Mini Mental State Exam). In here, Teach the system to 
            identify defects in the patients' writing abilities. This can include the capacity to 
            identify letters and write words, the forms of letters, and the length of pauses when 
            writing. Allocate marks to patients writing abilities by analyzing their flaws. The 
            collected samples would then be analyzed using automated methods, such as machine 
            learning algorithms such as (MobileNetV2, Resnet50 and InceptionV3), to detect 
            changes in patients' abilities over time. The algorithms would compare the current 
            samples with previous samples and identify any differences or decline in skills.</p>

          <h2> Research Problem</h2>
          <p>Dementia is a disease that impairs the ability to remember, think, or make decisions 
            and interferes with everyday activities. The second most typical form of dementia is vascular 
            dementia. It is caused by issues with the blood flow to the brain. Vascular dementia can have 
            a sudden onset, with symptoms appearing suddenly after a stroke or a series of small strokes. 
            The progression of vascular dementia can be more variable than that of other diseases. In 
            some cases, the symptoms of vascular dementia can improve with treatment, but in many 
            other cases, the symptoms will persist and may worsen over time.
            The treatment of vascular dementia can vary depending on the underlying cause of 
            blood vessel damage and may include medications, lifestyle changes, rehabilitation, and 
            surgery. The diagnosis of vascular dementia can be more challenging than the diagnosis of 
            other types of dementia diseases, as it requires a comprehensive evaluation of medical 
            history, symptoms, and test results, including imaging tests and blood tests.
            The easiest way to identify if a person is normal or atypical is with a simple 
            questionnaire. There are a few tests that are used, such as the Neuropsychiatry Unit 
            Cognitive Assessment Tool (NUCAG) and the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE), that give 
            patients a series of questions and tasks to determine their various cognitive functions. Most 
            of them are still happening as a manual process. A doctor or a nurse would ask the questions 
            and assign the tasks, and based on the patient's responses, they would assign a suitable 
            grade. If this process were automated, the data collected could be used for a variety of other 
            purposes. Also, each patient's efficient treatment process can be different from one to 
            another, and finding out which one of them is which can be easier with those tests too..

<br><br></p><h5>Predict risk of dementia through ability to follow simple commands.</h5><p>
The use of command-following abilities to identify dementia through advanced technologies is relatively new compared to other methods. It has the potential to bring new levels of accuracy, efficiency, and accessibility to the detection of 
dementia. Also, an accurate marking system that could help doctors make more accurate diagnoses and treatment decisions based on patients' commands following abilities, language skills, and understanding skills can be considered 
unique.
<br><br></p><h5>Predict risk of dementia through writing skills</h5>
<p>The collected samples would then be analyzed using automated methods, such as machine learning algorithms, to detect changes in patients' abilities over time. The algorithms would compare the current samples with previous samples and identify any differences or decline in skills.

<br><br></p><h5>Simple mathematical and orientation question series for analyze the problem solving skills of a dementia patient.</h5>
<p>Output will offer feedback to the doctor on their patients' performance, highlighting areas where they are strong and areas where they need to improve, and it will be useful for quickly identifying the user's level of proficiency. From this type of implementation, I hope it will be helpful for doctors to make more accurate diagnoses and treatment decisions.

<br><br></p><h5>Categorizing a person as normal or having a risk of suffering from dementia based on speech</h5>
<p>Use of keyword analysis as a method to determine if patients with dementia are having difficulty remembering certain words or concepts. The idea is that changes in language abilities can be an early indicator of cognitive decline in 
  patients with dementia, and by analyzing their speech for difficulty remembering specific words, it may be possible to detect these changes and potentially diagnose dementia at an early stage.

          <h2> Methodology</h2>
          <p>to predict risk of dementia through writing skills.This can include traits like the capacity to identify letters and write words, the forms of letters and the length of pauses when writing. In the following section, the ability of dementia patients to speak will be assessed. Patient behaviors such as speech speed, rhythm, pause duration, and keyword frequency will be considered, and a scoring system will be assigned based on them. In the next part, the patients' ability to understand language will be tested based on their hand movements, head movements, rhythm, pause duration, and rotation by giving them simple commands to follow. And then the patients' mathematical ability will be tested by giving them simple questions 
            based on them.
<br><br></p><h5>Data Collection</h5><p>
Because the topic is based on vascular dementia, which is a medical domain, the need for medical expertise to achieve the research goals is extremely high. So, we have found resources that could help us with medical expertise. Dr. Lakmal Ponnamperuma, who is a lecturer from the Psychology Department of SLIIT and a psychiatrist with expert knowledge in psychological assessment, has agreed to help us as our external supervisor. As we are more focused on the mental perspective of the disease, Dr. Lakmal Ponnamperuma will be a big help for the future of our project. Also, it is crucial to have a comprehensive understanding of the dementia symptoms, how they affect each cognitive function, and how they progress over time. It is important to have knowledge of how to protect patients' privacy and confidentiality when designing a system for dementia patients. It is important to have a good understanding of these medications, their side effects, and how to manage any potential interactions. Also, we need to have a good knowledge of what technologies we require to create the system and what kind of data we need to train the program, such as that.In addition, as mentioned above, we need datasets to train the system and also to test the product after it is created. For that, we are in contact with the medical faculty at the University of Peradeniya and the Kandy National Hospital to determine our data needs and expert knowledge.
<br><br></p><h5>Developing the model</h5><p>
  This research belongs to the machine learning model. Therefore, the machine learning model training process has been followed throughout the methodology. Before developing the final model various types of models have been developed based on previous research to determine the best algorithm which provides higher rates of accuracy. When considering the disease identification component, image augmentation has been used to randomize the form of each image to provide better accuracy.
  Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have been used for the disease identification process. This model provides more accuracy than others. The model extracts feature on its own, thereby learning by itself to provide higher accuracy. CNN basically uses segments and layers of the original image, identifies key features aggregates them and derive at a partial prediction. 
<br><br></p><h5>Output</h5><p>
These models were integrated into a mobile application to provide usability for the doctors. While developing the application the type of users that will be working with this application were taken into consideration. User friendly User Interfaces were designed to let doctors use this application easily.
